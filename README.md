## Coastal Risk Assessment Framework

Bespoke coastal risk assessments play a crucial role in empowering coastal communities to build resilience to the impacts of tropical cyclones. This framework evaluates the magnitude of these risks, going from cyclone tracks to very high resolution projections of flood extent. At Woodwell, we provide selected communities with free assessments of climate change-influenced risk in the near and long term. Forming a part of our extensive climate assessment suite, this framework is designed to be efficient and flexible, ensuring delivery within 6 weeks for anywhere in the world.
